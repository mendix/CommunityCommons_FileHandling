### Gradle 
In version 1.3.0, we introduce dependency management using a [Gradle](https://gradle.org/install/) build file.
The Gradle build file makes sure all required dependencies are copied into the `userlib` folder of the project.
To download the dependencies and copy them to the `userlib/` folder, execute the following command:
```
gradle prepareDeps
``` 
from the command line. 

Unfortunately, this doesn't mean that obsoleted jars are automatically deleted from your projects' `userlib` folder when you import the FileHandling module into your app model.

### Exporting the module
Only select the files from the userlib directory which have an equivalent file with the `Filehandling.RequiredLib` extension.
